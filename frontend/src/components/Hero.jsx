          just threw his newspaper on the <br /> floor, and he said, “David,
          David, David. You are not <br /> poor.” He said, “Poor is a
          mentality.” He said, “It’s a <br /> mentality that very few people
          ever recover from.

          Don’t you forget it, son. You are broke.”
